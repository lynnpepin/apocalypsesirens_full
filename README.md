# Apocalypse Sirens

GIMP + Python to automatically lay out and set up cards. 

Quick and dirty WIP, with tons of stolen art. 
(Except the clown art, by Rae Whiteley, the muse orbs, and the Super Obama art, which was edited by me using stolen Chaos Emerald sprites and a stolen photo of Obama.) The rules aren't documented either and don't work even if they were.

I made this in 2020, and forgot a ton of the details... But I think it's something like this:

- Card details live in **spirits.csv**.

- Card art lives in **sirens/assets**.

- Run **script_2.py** inside the **bossfights_newsize.xcf**

I didn't really check, though. It's been five years. Good luck!
